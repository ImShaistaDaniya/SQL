<!--Generate the following two result sets:

(i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:-->

SELECT CONCAT(NAME, 
              CASE
              WHEN OCCUPATION="Professor" THEN "(P)"
              WHEN OCCUPATION="Doctor" THEN "(D)"              
              WHEN OCCUPATION="Actor" THEN "(A)"              
              WHEN OCCUPATION="Singer" THEN "(S)"              
              END)
FROM OCCUPATIONS ORDER BY NAME;
SELECT "There are a total of ", COUNT(OCCUPATION), CONCAT(" ", LOWER(OCCUPATION),"s.") from OCCUPATIONS group by OCCUPATION order by COUNT(OCCUPATION), OCCUPATION ASC;
